   This code is used for an automatic garage door opening device that is similar to what is in the Tesla system. It allows a user to automatically close garage doors behind him or her when leaving a home and to open the aforementioned doors again upon return. This is accomplished through a simple GPS module, an Arduino, and a standard garage door opener such as Liftmaster. Lastly, this design allows the user to retain the complete functionality of the original garage door opener so that it can be reprogrammed or operated in manual mode.  # Garage-Project-File
